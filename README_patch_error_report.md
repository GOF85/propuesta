# PATCH ERROR REPORT

The patch for README.md failed due to a line count mismatch (origIndex 135 > len(lines) 125). The file appears to be only 125 lines long. The correct patch should only target lines 61-125. The next step is to reformat lines 61-125 for Markdown compliance, ensuring blank lines before/after headings, lists, and code blocks, and apply the patch strictly within the file's length.

## Next Steps
- Reformat lines 61-125 of README.md for Markdown compliance.
- Ensure all changes are within the file's actual line count.
- Re-attempt patch application.
